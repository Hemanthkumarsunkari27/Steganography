A Python-based steganography project that securely hides messages within images using OpenCV and a password-protected approach.  

---

## 📌 Features  
✅ Hide secret messages inside images without noticeable changes.  
✅ Password-protected encryption and decryption.  
✅ Lightweight implementation using OpenCV.  
✅ Works with standard image formats like JPG and PNG.  
✅ Simple command-line execution, compatible with Python IDLE.  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, OS, String  
- **Concepts Used:** Steganography, Image Processing, Cryptography

## 🚀 Installation & Setup  
### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/steganography.git
cd steganography
```
### **2️⃣ Install Dependencies**  
```sh (Through command prompt)
pip install opencv-python
```
### 3️⃣ Run the Script in Python IDLE or other Python environments  
```sh
python stego.py
```

---

## 📸 Usage  
### 🔹 Encoding a Message  
1️⃣ Run `stego.py`  
2️⃣ Enter the secret message.  
3️⃣ Set a passcode for encryption.  
4️⃣ The encrypted image (`encryptedImage.jpg`) is saved.  

### 🔹 Decoding a Message 
1️⃣ Run `stego.py` again.  
2️⃣ Enter the correct passcode.  
3️⃣ The hidden message is revealed in the terminal.
